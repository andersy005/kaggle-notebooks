# [Robocall Complaints](https://www.kaggle.com/fcc/robocall-complaints)

**Consumer complaints filed with the FCC** 

Individual informal consumer complaint data detailing complaints filed with the Consumer Help Center beginning October 31, 2014. This data represents information selected by the consumer. The FCC does not verify the facts alleged in these complaints.

This dataset contains everything you need to analyze the jerk companies who call during dinner: time, mode of communication, logged phone number (of the hassler), and what they were trying to do. 

### Acknowledgements

This dataset was kindly made available by the FCC. You can find [the original dataset here][1].
