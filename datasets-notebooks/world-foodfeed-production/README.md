[Who eats the food we grow?
Worldwide food\feed production and distribution, 1961-2013 ](https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production)

### Context

Our world population is expected to grow from [7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion in the year 2050][1]. Finding solutions for feeding the growing world population has become a hot topic for [food and agriculture organizations][2], [entrepreneurs][3] and [philanthropists][4]. These solutions range from changing the way we [grow our food][5] to changing the [way we eat][6]. To make things harder, the world's climate is changing and it is both affecting and affected by the way we grow our food â€“ agriculture. 
**This dataset provides an insight on our worldwide food production** - focusing on a comparison between food produced for human consumption and feed produced for animals.



### Content

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations provides [free access to food and agriculture data][7] for over 245 countries and territories, from the year 1961 to the most recent update (depends on the dataset). One dataset from the FAO's database is the Food Balance Sheets. It presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period, the last time an update was loaded to the FAO database was in 2013. The food balance sheet shows for each food item the sources of supply and its utilization. This chunk of the dataset is focused on two utilizations of each food item available:

 - **Food** - refers to the total amount of the food item available as human food during the reference period.
 - **Feed** - refers to the quantity of the food item available for feeding to the livestock and poultry during the reference period.

### Acknowledgements

This dataset was meticulously gathered, organized and published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 

### Inspiration

Animal agriculture and factory farming is a a growing interest of the public and of world leaders.

 - Can you find interesting outliers in the data?
 - What are the fastest growing countries in terms of food production\consumption?
 - Compare between food and feed consumption.
